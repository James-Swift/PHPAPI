This project is still in development and is not complete enough to even function as yet. I'm creating my own API framework 
rather than using someone else's because:

- What's the point of writing an API and only being able to call it over HTTP?
- I want to be able to call the API from within PHP with as little overhead as possible
- I want a simple framework
- I want the power of reg-ex for matching paths
